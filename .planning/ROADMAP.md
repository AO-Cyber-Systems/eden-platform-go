# Roadmap — eden-platform-go

> **Canonical roadmap:** `eden-libs/.planning/ROADMAP.md` covers Objectives
> 1–33 spanning every sibling repo in the workspace. This file is a
> **repo-scoped projection**: only the objectives whose code (or substantial
> code) ships in eden-platform-go are listed here, with status as of the
> head of `main`.

**M9 milestone reached 2026-05-11** — Eden Family launch-ready.
Portfolio standardization plan §1–§11 complete. Post-M9 work is
maintenance + AO ID hardening (see "Post-M9" section below).

### Active work streams (tracked via commit prefixes; canonical plan TBD)

These are not yet stood up as portfolio-level objectives. The work lives
in main via incremental commits with internal phase numbering (`aoid-NN-MM`,
`NN-MM`). When ready to plan formally, run
`/devflow:plan-objective <num>` against the parent eden-libs and import
TRDs back here.

- **AO ID identity-service buildout** — recent commit prefixes
  `aoid-08-*`, `aoid-09-*`, `aoid-11-*` (account-admin RPCs,
  recertification, MFA clear, AC2 / AuditQuery / SelfRecovery extensions,
  BreakGlass event ingestion).
- **Policy cache infrastructure** — prefix `10-0*` (PolicyCache
  combinator + Cache + PostgresListener + IntervalPoller; risk evaluator;
  signed audit forwarder; canonical JSON; GeoIP wrapper).
- **KMS deepening** — prefix `13-0*` (currently softkey; AWS KMS / GCP KMS
  drivers expected to follow).
